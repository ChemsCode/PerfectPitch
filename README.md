# Perfect Pitch

#### Setting Up the Backend

1.  **Navigate to the Backend Directory**: Open a terminal and change the directory to the backend folder of your project.
    
    bashCopy code
    
    `cd backend`
    
2.  **Set Up Environment Variables**: Create a `.env` file in the backend directory. You will need to define an environment variable for the OpenAI API key.
    
    *   Sign up for an OpenAI API key if you haven't already.
    *   Open the `.env` file with a text editor and add the following line:
        
        cssCopy code
        
        `OPENAI_API_KEY=[Your OpenAI API key here]`
        
    
    Replace `[Your OpenAI API key here]` with the actual API key.
    
3.  **Install Dependencies**: Install the necessary npm packages for the backend.
    
    cssCopy code
    
    `npm i`
    
4.  **Run the Backend Server**: Start the development server for the backend.
    
    arduinoCopy code
    
    `npm run dev`
    

#### Setting Up the Frontend

1.  **Navigate to the Frontend Directory**: Open another terminal window and change the directory to the frontend folder of your project.
    
    bashCopy code
    
    `cd frontend`
    
2.  **Install Dependencies**: Install the necessary npm packages for the frontend.
    
    cssCopy code
    
    `npm i`
    
3.  **Run the Frontend Server**: Start the development server for the frontend.
    
    arduinoCopy code
    
    `npm run dev`
    

By following these organized steps, both your frontend and backend should be up and running correctly. Make sure to keep your API key secure and not share it publicly in your code or version control systems.
